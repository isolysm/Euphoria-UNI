# Euphoria-UNI
1.8.9 has been deprecated by this organization, and we won't provide support for this mod unless absolutely needed. Contributors can contribute, although it might be useless considering we aren't going to support this.

I will add a butterfly to the bottom right once this mod queefs hard enough idk

You require OpenGL 3.3 in order to run this mod, as we are using GLSL for the blur in this mod, so either turn the blur off, or we are going to have a problem here.
