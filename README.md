# Euphoria-UNI
A very stable mod, currently in beta, and will be merged into the Euphoria repository soon (TM)

I will add a butterfly to the bottom right once this mod queefs hard enough idk

You require OpenGL 3.3 in order to run this mod, as we are using GLSL for the blur in this mod, so either turn the blur off, or we are going to have a problem here.

**TODO: Rewrite in Fabric because I officially show 0 motivation for developing in Forge or supporting the 1.8.9 community.**
